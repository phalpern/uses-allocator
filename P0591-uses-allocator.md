Abstract
========
The phrase "*Uses-allocator construction* with allocator `Alloc`" is defined
in section **[allocator.uses.construction]** of the standard (23.10.7.2 of the
2017 DIS). Although the definition is
reasonably concise, it fails to handle the case of constructing a `std::pair`
where one or both members can use `Alloc`. This omission manifests in
significant text describing the `construct` members of `polymorphic_allocator`
[memory.polymorphic.allocator.class] and `scoped_allocator_adaptor`
[allocator.adaptor]. Additionally neither `polymorphic_allocator` nor
`scoped_allocator_adaptor` recursively pass the allocator to a `std::pair` in
which one or both members is a `std::pair`.

Though we could add the `pair` special case to the definition of
*Uses-allocator construction*, the definition would no longer be
concise. Moreover, any library implementing features that rely on
*Uses-allocator construction* would necessarily centralize the logic
into a function template. This paper, therefore, proposes a set of templates
that do exactly this centralization, in the standard. The current uses of
*Uses-allocator
construction* could then simply defer to these templates, making those
features simpler to describe and future-proof against other changes.

Because this proposal modifies wording in the standard, it is targeted at
C++20 (aka, C++Next) rather than at a technical specification.

Changes from R2
===============

 * Renamed `make_using_allocator` to `make_obj_using_allocator` as per LEWG
   vote in Jacksonville.

 * Added example of use.

 * Changed audience to LWG after approval by LEWG in Jacksonville, March 2018.

Changes from R1
===============

 * Fix bugs in formal wording. Everything in this paper has been implemented
   and tested (and a link to the implementation added).

 * Explicitly called out recursive handling for a `std::pair` containing a
   `std::pair`. (No change to actual functionality from R0.)

 * Update section references to match C++17 DIS.

 * Minor editorial changes.

Changes from R0
===============

 * Fixed function template prototypes, which incorrectly depended on partial
   specialization of functions.

Choosing a direction
====================

Originally, I considered proposing a pair of function templates,
`make_obj_using_allocator<T>(allocator, args...)` and
`uninitialized_construct_using_allocator(ptrToT, allocator,
args...)`. However, implementation experience with the feature being proposed
showed that, given a type `T`, an allocator `A`, and an argument list
`Args...`, it was convenient to generate a `tuple` of the final
argument list for `T`'s constructor, then use `make_from_tuple` or `apply` to
implement the above function templates. It occurred to me that exposing this
`tuple`-building function may be desirable, as it opens the door to an entire
category of functions that use `tuple`s to manipulate argument lists in a
composable fashion.

Example
=======

If we are creating a simple wrapper class around an object of type `T`, our
class might look something like this:

    template <typename T, class Alloc = std::allocator<T>>
    class Wrapper {
      Alloc m_alloc;
      T     m_data;
      int   m_meta_data;
      ...
    public:
      using allocator_type = Alloc;

      Wrapper(const T& v, const allocator_type& alloc = {});
      ...
    };

This wrapper is intended to work with many types for `T`, including types that
don't use an allocator at all, types that take an allocator on construction
using the `allocator_arg` protocol, and types that take an allocator on
construction as a trailing argument. The constructor for `Wrapper` would thus
require much metaprogramming in order to handle all of the cases. This
metaprogramming is already done by implementers of the standard library,
because it is needed by `scoped_allocator_adaptor` and by
`pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, but such metaprogramming is beyond the skills of
most programmers and is time consuming for even those possessing the skills.
The facilities in this proposal make the task almost trivial.
The `Wrapper` constructor below takes advantage of the
`make_obj_using_allocator` function template to construct the `m_data` member
using the supplied allocator. The allocator will be ignored if `T` does not
use an allocator or uses an allocator of a different type.

    template <typename T, class Alloc>
    Wrapper<T,Alloc>::Wrapper(const T& v, const Alloc& alloc)
      : m_alloc(alloc)
      , m_data(make_obj_using_allocator<T>(alloc, v))
      , m_meta_data(0)
      , etc.
      { ... }

Proposed wording
================

Wording is relative to the March 2017 DIS, N4660.

Header `<memory>` synopsis [memory.syn]
---------------------------------------

Add the following new function templates to the to the `<memory>` synopsis:

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, Args&&... args) -> see below;

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      T* uninitialized_construct_using_allocator(T* p,
                                                 const Alloc& a,
                                                 Args&&... args);

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      T make_obj_using_allocator(const Alloc& a, Args&&... args);

Uses-allocator construction [allocator.uses.construction]
---------------------------------------------------------

Add the following descriptions to uses-allocator-construction.

**Guidance needed**: The wording below expresses
  `uses_allocator_construction_args` as a bunch of overloads using "does not
  participate in overload-resolution" wording. It could also be expressed as a
  single (variadic) function with a bunch of special cases called out, or it
  could be described with less code and more descriptive English.  Which
  is better for comprehending the standard?

**Guidance needed**: The wording uses `forward_as_tuple`, which prevents
  copies, and doesn't require copy- or move-constructibility, but can result
  in dangling references if the resulting `tuple` outlives the full expression
  in which it was created. Should I repeat the cautionary
  words already found in the description of `forward_as_tuple`?

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, Args&&... args) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution if `T`
  is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: A `tuple` value determined as follows: 

> - if `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is false and
    `is_constructible_v<T, Args...>` is true, return
    `forward_as_tuple(std::forward<Args>(args)...)`.

> - otherwise, if `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true and
    `is_constructible_v<T, allocator_arg_t, Alloc, Args...>` is true, return
    `forward_as_tuple(allocator_arg, alloc, std::forward<Args>(args)...)`.

> - otherwise, if `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true and
    `is_constructible_v<T, Args..., Alloc>` is true, return
    `forward_as_tuple(std::forward<Args>(args)..., alloc)`.

> - otherwise, the program is ill-formed. [_Note_: An error will result if
    `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true but the specific constructor does not
    take an allocator. This definition prevents a silent failure to pass the
    allocator to a constructor. â€” _end note_]

    template <class T, class Alloc, class Tuple1, class Tuple2>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, piecewise_construct_t,
                                            Tuple1&& x, Tuple2&& y) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to

            return make_tuple(piecewise_construct,
                      apply([&a](auto&&... args1) -> auto {
                              return uses_allocator_construction_args<T1>(a,
                                     std::forward<decltype(args1)>(args1)...);
                          }, std::forward<Tuple1>(x)),
                      apply([&a](auto&&... args2) -> auto {
                              return uses_allocator_construction_args<T2>(a,
                                     std::forward<decltype(args2)>(args2)...);
                          }, std::forward<Tuple2>(y)));

    template <class T>

  `uses_allocator_construction_args<pair<T1,T2>>(a,
  piecewise_construct, forward_as_tuple(std::forward<U>(u)),
  forward_as_tuple(std::forward<V>(v)))`.

    template <class T, class Alloc, class U, class V>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, const pair<U,V>& pr) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by

    template <class T, class Alloc, class U, class V>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, pair<U,V>&& pr) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      T make_obj_using_allocator(const Alloc& a, Args&&... args);

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by

            make_from_tuple<T>(
                uses_allocator_construction_args<T>(a, forward<Args>(args)...));

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      T* uninitialized_construct_using_allocator(T* p,
                                                 const Alloc& a,
                                                 Args&&... args);

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to:

            return apply([p](auto&&... args2){
                    return ::new(static_cast<void*>(p))
                        T(forward<decltype(args2)>(args2)...);
                }, uses_allocator_construction_args<T>(a, forward<Args>(args)...));

**Guidance Needed**: Should we consider adding
`uninitialized_construct_from_tuple` as a separate (non-exposition) function,
since it appears to be useful and would simplify (or perhaps eliminate the
need for) `uninitialized_construct_using_allocator`.

Changes to `polymorphic_allocator` and `scoped_allocator_adaptor`
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Rewrite the `construct` methods of `polymorphic_allocator`
[mem.poly.allocator.mem] and `scoped_allocator_adaptor`
[allocator.adaptor.members] to simply call
`uninitialized_construct_from_tuple`.

Consider replacing all uses of _uses allocator construction_ with references
to these functions and removing  _uses allocator construction_ from the
standard.
