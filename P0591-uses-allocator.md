Abstract
========
The phrase "*Uses-allocator construction* with allocator `Alloc`" is defined
in section **[allocator.uses.construction]** of the standard (20.7.7.2 of the
2014 standard or 20.10.7.2 of the 2016 CD). Although the definition is
reasonably concise, it fails to handle the case of constructing a `std::pair`
where one or both members can use `Alloc`. This omission manifests in
significant text describing the `construct` members of `polymorphic_allocator`
[memory.polymorphic.allocator.class] and `scoped_allocator_adaptor`
[allocator.adaptor]. Additionally, a `vector<pair<T,U>, A>` fails to pass the
allocator to the pair elements if `A` is a scoped or polymorphic allocator.

Though we could add the `pair` special case to the definition of
*Uses-allocator construction*, the definition would no longer be
concise. Moreover, any library implementing features that rely on
*Uses-allocator construction* would necessarily centralize the logic
into a function template. This paper, therefore, proposes a set of templates
that do exactly this centralization, in the standard. The current uses of
*Uses-allocator
construction* could then simply defer to these templates, making those
features simpler to describe and future-proof against other changes.

Because this proposal modifies wording in the standard, it is targeted at
C++20 (aka, C++Next) rather than a technical specification.

Changes from R0
===============

 * Fixed function template prototypes, which incorrectly depended on partial
   specialization of functions.

Choosing a direction
====================

Originally, I considered proposing a pair of function templates,
`make_using_allocator<T>(allocator, args...)` and
`uninitialized_construct_using_allocator(ptrToT, allocator,
args...)`. However, implementation experience with the feature being proposed
showed that, given a type `T`, an allocator `A`, and an argument list
`Args...`, it was convenient to generate a `tuple` of the final
argument list for `T`'s constructor, then use `make_from_tuple` or `apply` to
implement the above function templates. It occurred to me that exposing this
`tuple`-building function may be desirable, as it opens the door to an entire
category of functions that use `tuple`s to manipulate argument lists in a
composable fashion.

If the basics of this proposal are accepted by LEWG, there would need to be a
discussion of exactly what should be standardized. The options are:

 1. Standardize the function template that generates a `tuple` of arguments.
 2. Standardize the function templates that actually construct a `T` from an
    allocator and list of arguments.
 3. Both.

This proposal chooses option 3, but I am open to the other options.
    
Proposed wording
================

The following wording is still rough. More detailed wording to come after LEWG
review and revision. Wording is relative to the November 2016 Committee Draft,
N5131.

**Guidance needed**: The wording uses `forward_as_tuple`, which prevents
  copies, and doesn't require copy- or move-constructibility, but can result
  in dangling references if the resulting `tuple` outlives the full expression
  in which it was created. Is this OK? If so, should I repeat the cautionary
  words already found in the description of `forward_as_tuple`?

Add the following new function templates to `<memory>`:

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, Args&&... args) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution if `T`
  is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: A `tuple` value determined as follows: 

> - if `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is false and
    `is_constructible_v<T, Args...>` is true, return
    `forward_as_tuple(std::forward<Args>(args)...)`.

> - otherwise, if `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true and
    `is_constructible_v<T, allocator_arg_t, Alloc, Args...>` is true, return
    `forward_as_tuple(allocator_arg, alloc, std::forward<Args>(args)...)`.

> - otherwise, if `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true and
    `is_constructible_v<T, Args..., Alloc>` is true, return
    `forward_as_tuple(std::forward<Args>(args)..., alloc)`.

> - otherwise, the program is ill-formed. [_Note_: An error will result if
    `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true but the specific constructor does not
    take an allocator. This definition prevents a silent failure to pass the
    allocator to a constructor. â€” _end note_]

    template <class T, class... Args1, class... Args2>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a,
                                            piecewise_construct_t,
                                            tuple<Args1...> x,
                                            tuple<Args2...> y) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to

        make_tuple(piecewise_construct,
                   apply(x, [](Args1... args1) -> auto {
                      return uses_allocator_construction_args<T1>(a,
                                 std::forward<Args1>(args1)...);
                   }),
                   apply(y, [](Args2... args2) -> auto {
                      return uses_allocator_construction_args<T2>(a,
                                  std::forward<Args2>(args2)...);
                   }));

    template <class T>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to
  `uses_allocator_construction_args<pair<T1,T2>>(a, piecewise_construct,
  tuple<>{}, tuple<>{})`

    template <class T, class U, class V>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, U&& u, V&& v) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to
  `uses_allocator_construction_args<pair<T1,T2>>(a,
  piecewise_construct, forward_as_tuple(std::forward<U>(u)),
  forward_as_tuple(std::forward<V>(v)))`.

    template <class T, class U, class V>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, const pair<U,V>& pr) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to
  `uses_allocator_construction_args<pair<T1,T2>>(a, piecewise_construct,
  forward_as_tuple(pr.first), forward_as_tuple(pr.second))`.

    template <class T, class U, class V>
      auto uses_allocator_construction_args(const Alloc& a, pair<U,V>&& pr) -> see below;

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to
  `uses_allocator_construction_args<pair<T1,T2>>(a,
  piecewise_construct, forward_as_tuple(std::forward<U>(pr.first)),
  forward_as_tuple(std::forward<V>(pr.second)))`.

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      T make_using_allocator(const Alloc& a, Args&&... args);

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by
  the caller. This template does not participate in overload resolution unless
  `T` is a specialization of `std::pair`.

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, equivalent to

        make_from_tuple<T>(
            uses_allocator_construction_args<T>(a, forward<Args>(args)...));

    template <class T, class Alloc, class... Args>
      T* uninitialized_construct_using_allocator(T* p,
                                                 const Alloc& a,
                                                 Args&&... args);

> _Remark_: `T` is not deduced and must therefore be specified explicitly by

> _Returns_: For `T` specified as `pair<T1, T2>`, and given the
  exposition-only function template:

        template <class T, class... A>
          uninitialized_construct_from_tuple(T* p, tuple<A...>&& t) {
            apply(std::move(t), [](A&&... args) { 
              ::new(static_cast<void*>(p)) T(std::forward<A>(args)...);
            });
          }
  
> equivalent to

        uninitialized_construct_from_tuple(
            p,
            uses_allocator_construction_args<T>(a, forward<Args>(args)...));

**Guidance Needed**: Should we consider adding
`uninitialized_construct_from_tuple` as a separate (non-exposition) function,
since it appears to be useful and it's hard to do the same thing without
creating a named function?

Additionally, rewrite the `construct` methods of `polymorphic_allocator` and
`scoped_allocator_adaptor` in terms of the above.

Consider replacing all uses of _uses allocator construction_ with references
to these functions and removing  _uses allocator construction_ from the
standard.
